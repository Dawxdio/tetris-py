# tetris-py


## Introduction
This is a project I made for my 'Fundamentals of Programming' course at university. The assignment was to code a simple game, using terminal output as a graphics interface.
Out of all the avalible topics, Tetris seemed the most interesting (and hardest to code) to me, which is why I chose it.
This project contains zero AI-written code and minimal amounts of code from forums like Stack Overflow, most of it came straight from my chaotic perfectionist brain.
